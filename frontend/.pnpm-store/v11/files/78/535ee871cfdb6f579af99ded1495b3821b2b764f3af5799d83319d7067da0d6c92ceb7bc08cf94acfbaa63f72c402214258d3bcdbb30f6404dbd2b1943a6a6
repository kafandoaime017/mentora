 * Classifies a Response as streaming or non-streaming.
 *
 * Heuristics:
 * - No body → not streaming
 * - Known streaming Content-Types → streaming (SSE, NDJSON, JSON streaming)
 * - text/plain without Content-Length → streaming (some AI APIs)
 * - Otherwise → not streaming (conservative default, including HTML/SSR)
 *
 * We avoid probing the stream to prevent blocking on transform streams (like injectTraceMetaTags)
 * or SSR streams that may not have data ready immediately.
